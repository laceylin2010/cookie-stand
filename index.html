    <h2><b><u>About me</u></b></h2>


    <p>Hi, My name is Pat and I have lived in Seattle for most of my life. Seattle is very well known for its seafood. The longer I have lived here, the more I have realized how our seafood is really the best. Fish is obvisouly my favorite, hence the reason I opened up my own business. I was inspired by my brother who loves baking. He bakes anything from banana bread, to chocolate chip cookies, to cinnamon rolls and etc. Of course, he also is a fish lover like me.</p>

    <p> We were out drinking some coffee at the most popular coffee place in Seattle, Starbucks of course, when we began talking about all the types of things he loved to bake. It then dawned on me, Hey! Lets start our own business. As we sat there talking we then started coming up with an original idea. Something we have never seen sold in bakeries..SALMON COOKIES! We tested them out with family to make sure they tasted alright, but sure enough, it came out amazing. It doesnt have as much salmon as you would think in the flavor. It may sound gross at first, but you will never know if something is good unless you try it! So be daring, and come try a salmon cookie at one of our locations.</p>
